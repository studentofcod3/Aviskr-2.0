Trump authorized 75 drone strikes in his first 74 days in office, approximately one strike a day on average, which represents a five-fold increase over Obama\u2019s rate. Thus, despite Trump\u2019s rhetoric of isolationism and alleged break with the past, current US operations resemble a marriage of George W. Bush-era \u201cworld battlefield\u201d global militarisation with Obama-era tools of remote warfare, with its \u201cminimal footprint\u201d and aversion to ground operations\u2014a transactional neo-conservatism for the post-imperial era."),i.a.createElement("p",null,"Outside of America\u2019s official battlefields, Yemen has been a central target of Trump\u2019s drone campaign. The first three drone strikes conducted under Trump targeted al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in central Yemen, followed a few days later by the deadly and compromised JSOC raid in Yemen. Since then, the United States has conducted over 100 airstrikes and raids against an emergent ISIL branch in Yemen, a figure that surpasses any previous year of strikes under Obama. Somalia has also been a major target of renewed drone strikes and clandestine operations by JSOC against both the al-Qaida-affiliated al-Shabaab and a small local branch of ISIL that has emerged in the north. In all, over 30 airstrikes have been launched against Somalia in 2017, in conjunction with a number of US military Special Operations Forces raids. That figure already eclipses the 14 strikes carried out in 2016. There has been a marked increase in US drone strikes in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region in the second half of 2017 following the roll out of President Trump\u2019s Afghanistan strategy, in which he vowed to \u201cno longer be silent about Pakistan\u2019s safe havens for terrorist organizations.\u201d After a September campaign of drone strikes in Pakistan, the CIA declined to comment when asked if they had carried out a strike, suggesting that in fact they had although we must consider that an absence of confirmation is not indicative of the fact. Trump has returned authority to conduct drone strikes to the CIA, which the Obama administration had limited in its second term. Although largely responsible for the expansion and consolidation of this form of war, President Obama took some steps towards establishing a more benevolent authoritative figure at the apex of his second term."),i.a.createElement("p",null,"Under Trump, there is an increasing distance from political and ultimately, human controls. The rapid evolution of this modern means of engaging in war has largely escaped public scrutiny due to its secretive nature and origins as a deeply clandestine counterterrorism program. Public criticism, to the extent it has been aired, has largely focused on concerns about civilian casualties and the dangerous automation of warfare possible through these technologies, but not the form of warfare itself. War is taking the form of a globally expanded and increasingly autonomous policing operation intended to regulate and discipline, often out of sight of American public awareness."),i.a.createElement("p",null,"Trump\u2019s array of generals have another kindred characteristic, which most likely drew them to Trump but also runs counter to a neo-isolationist foreign policy. Nearly all of them have expressed public opposition to aspects of Obama\u2019s second-term foreign policy that included an alleged hesitancy to use force or commit troops, which many allies perceived as a retreat from traditional U.S. commitments in the world. For example, they publicly faulted Obama for setting a deadline for withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, blamed his decision to pull all U.S. troops out of Iraq in 2011 for the rise of the ISIL, and have been critical of the White House\u2019s sensitivity to \u201cboots on the ground\u201d in the anti-ISIL campaign."))),i.a.createElement("div",null,i.a.createElement(J.Element,{name:"conclusion",className:"heading"},"Conclusion"),i.a.createElement("div",null,i.a.createElement("p",null,"The first year of the Trump administration demonstrated President Trump\u2019s willingness to continue to rely on armed drones to conduct U.S. military and counterterrorism operations around the world. While drone use is expanding under the Trump administration, transparency and oversight of the U.S. drone program appear to be diminishing. Such retreat of clarity by the United States is occurring alongside international efforts to advance global standards for the responsible transfer and use of armed drones. Questions remain about the efficacy of drone operations in achieving broader security objectives, and concerns abound about the negative consequences that could arise from continued use without the development of appropriate international standards to guide drone transfers and subsequent use. Despite these concerns, the United States has yet to develop a comprehensive U.S. drone policy that is transparent, accountable, and sustainable at a time when lethal drone technology continues to proliferate around the world."),i.a.createElement("p",null,"In short, the Trump administration\u2019s approach to U.S. drone policy shows worrying signs of potential actions that are designed to dismantle the nascent policy structure and safeguards established under the Obama administration.
